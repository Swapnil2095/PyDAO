# PyDAO
Generate a Python Class from a textual (CSV, TDF, Enpiped, etc.) data file. 

The generated code can be used to import, as well as work with (C.R.U.D and query using SQL SELECTions, 
etc.) that data.

EXAMPLE / TEST CASE
-------------------
Includes a classic "address book" example as a test case:

Data Example: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/tc001_data.txt

Generated Code: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/foo.py



STOCK MARKET
------------
Python 1000, Python 2000, and Python 3000 students who are 
participating in our Stock Market resume-builder will want 
to look at the NASDAQ database generator.

Selecting Data: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/GenNasdaqTest.py

While that stock exchange's official pipe-delimited ("enpiped" ;) data file is incuded for demonstrative
purposes, note that the most recent set of enpiped data tokens can be downloaded from the stock exchange.
