Data Example: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/tc001_data.txt

Generated Code: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/foo.py

Python 1000, Python 2000, and Python 3000 students who are 
participating in our Stock Market Resume-Builder will want 
to look at the NASDAQ database generator:

While a CSV file is incuded, note that the most recent set of tokens 
can be downloaded from the stock exchange.
