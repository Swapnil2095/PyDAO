Greetings!

Setting our sights upon importing data from the stock market, we felt the need to
create a tool that will quickly allow our students to convert delimited text + headers
into a Python class.

Plans are afoot to create an Order-interface, but for the moment please see:

Basic Tests:
===========
SqltDAO.DaoTest01.tc001_gen.py
SqltDAO.DaoTest01.tc001_driver.py

For Students:
============
SqltDAO.CodeGen01.GenNasdaq.py

For an example of how to create an Order so as to generate your code!
